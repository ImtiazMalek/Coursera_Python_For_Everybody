hi
This is a random text. i am going through my coursera course. So far it is helping me.
I am learning a lot. though I am still not sure whether it will help me in real life or not.
before this course I completerd pyhton in a youtube tutorial. But it didn't teach me that much.
It covered some of the basics. But I couldn't implement those in my real life.
but after doing coursera course I thing that I am really learning something because
the faculty is teaching me to solve some real time problem which can become helpful in 
my thesis work I guess. Letâ€™s see what happen.
